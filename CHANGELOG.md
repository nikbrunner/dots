  - Ensures consistent behavior across different systems

### üõ† Enhanced Debugging

- **Added Debug Flag Support**: Implemented `--debug` flag for comprehensive diagnostics
  - Available in `install.sh` and `link.sh` for troubleshooting
  - Provides detailed execution tracing during symlink operations
