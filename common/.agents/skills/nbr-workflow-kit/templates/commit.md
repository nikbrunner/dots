# Commit a change

This skill is the commit workflow for this repository. Its sections 3 to 5 hold the repo's docs list, checks, and commit
grammar; global commit workflows read them from here. To sort several changes into commits, use `nbr-git-commit-buckets`
when it is installed. Do not commit until the user approves the final message.
Keep unrelated work unstaged. Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`, stage secrets or credentials, or rewrite history without
explicit approval. Keep each commit atomic.

## 1. Survey the tree

Run:

```sh
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat
git log --oneline -5
```

Classify paths as **in scope**, **held back**, or **stray**. Surface unexpected edits and never hide them with reset,
restore, or clean.

## 2. Stage selectively

Stage named paths only:

```sh
git add path/to/file path/to/another-file
```

Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Unstage any held-back file a hook or helper touched.

## 3. Audit docs

When staged changes add or change a config key, command, or domain term, check {{docs}} against the diff. Fix and stage the
confirmed docs in this same commit.

## 4. Verify

Run:

```sh
{{check}}
{{lint_docs}}
```

`{{check}}` is the CI-parity pass. {{hooks}} If verification fails, fix the cause, restage, and run it again.

A docs-only change may skip `{{check}}`, but say that it was skipped.

{{e2e}}

## 5. Draft and ask

The message is a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). release-please derives the next version from it
and lists the subject in the release's `CHANGELOG.md` section:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>
```

{{suffix}}

- `feat` for new {{reader}}-facing behavior, `fix` for a {{reader}}-facing bug fix. Both trigger a release.
- `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `ci`, `chore` for the rest. Only `docs`, `refactor`, and `perf` count toward a release.
- `docs` is for {{reader}}-facing documentation. Agent skills, `AGENTS.md`, and maintainer-only docs are `chore`, so they
  never open a release on their own.
- The scope is the area, as in recent history: {{scopes}}. Omit it when the change spans areas.
- A breaking change adds `!` after the scope and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

Keep the subject under 70 characters, not counting a suffix, and describe the outcome, not the file list. Add a short bullet body only when the change
has several moving parts. Do not narrate history with phrases such as "instead of" or "no longer".

Show:

1. the final in-scope paths;
2. held-back and stray paths;
3. the exact commit message;
4. the verification result.

Then ask: **Go-ahead to commit?**

## 6. Commit after approval

Use a heredoc so the message stays intact:

```sh
git commit -m "$(cat <<'MSG'
<message>
MSG
)"
```

The hook runs its staged checks. If a hook fails, fix the cause, restage, and make a new commit attempt. Do not amend an
unrelated commit. Confirm the new log entry and final status.
