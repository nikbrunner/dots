# Release {{project}}

Follow [`docs/releases.md`](../../../docs/releases.md). It is the maintainer source of truth for the release PR, the curated
release section, and checking the GitHub Release.

Read the version from the release PR title after release-please has finished its run for the latest push to `main`; each
run can change the version. Curate the section on the release branch with [`repo-changelog`](../repo-changelog/SKILL.md).

{{release_assets}}

Nothing lands on `main` between curating and merging. Ask for explicit approval immediately before merging the release PR.
