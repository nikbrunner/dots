Apps like Firefox and Claude Desktop respect this setting.\n\n## Goal\nExtend `dots theme` to automatically set the system color-scheme when switching themes, so all apps respect the dark/light preference.\n\n## Implementation\n1. Ensure xdg-desktop-portal-gtk or xdg-desktop-portal-gnome is installed\n2. Modify theme switcher to run:\n   - `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'` for dark themes\n   - `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-light'` for light themes\n3. Theme metadata needs to indicate whether it's dark or light (may already exist in Black Atom theme definitions)\n\n## Verification\n```bash\ngdbus call --session \\\n  --dest=org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop \\\n  --object-path=/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop \\\n  --method=org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.Read \\\n  org.freedesktop.appearance color-scheme\n```\nShould return 1 for dark, 2 for light.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T18:10:08.038713603+01:00","created_by":"nbr","updated_at":"2026-01-11T18:10:26.387569925+01:00"}
{"id":"dots-n8p","title":"Add repos sync command for multi-machine workflow","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen working across multiple machines (e.g., Linux at home, Mac at work), it's easy to forget to push all changes before leaving. This leads to out-of-sync repos and lost work context.\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nAdded two new commands to `repos`:\n\n### `repos leave` - End of day workflow\nInteractive walkthrough of dirty repos with menu:\n1. Review in LazyGit\n2. Commit with AI (`repo sc`)\n3. Save as WIP (auto-commit with timestamp)\n4. Cleanup with Claude (multi-commit semantic cleanup)\n5. Push without committing\n6. Skip this repo\n7. Stop walkthrough\n\nAfter walkthrough, offers to batch push all repos with unpushed commits.\n\n### `repos arrive` - Start of day workflow\n```bash\nrepos arrive      # Parallel pull all repos\nrepos arrive -i   # Interactive mode for conflict handling\n```\n\nPulls all repos, reports: updated / conflicts / up-to-date / skipped.\n\n## Files Changed\n- `common/.local/bin/repos` - Added leave/arrive commands and helper functions","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-12T08:04:13.229257+01:00","created_by":"nbr","updated_at":"2026-01-12T08:36:04.040309+01:00"}
