# TODO

## High Priority

- [x] **Fix `dots status` symlink checking** - Fixed by delegating to external script like `link.sh`
- [x] Fix current `install` script
- [x] `dots sync`
  - Should check if there are current local changes before syncing and abort
    if so
  - After sync it should offer to run `dots link` to update symlinks
- [ ] Complete `install` script
  - [ ] deps
    - [ ] Homebrew on macOS
    - [ ] Obsidian
- [ ] `repos` - Complete ENSURED_INSTALL
  - [ ] `nikbrunner/notes`
  - [ ] `nikbrunner/dcd-notes`
  - [ ] `dealercenter-digital/...`
- [ ] Fix colorscheme mappings (wezterm / nvim / kitty / `.current_colors.json`)
- [ ] `deps` - Simplify dependency management by introducing config file for
      package names on different platforms
- [ ] **Linux** - Setup Wezterm & Multiplexer
  - If the bindings are not working, think about switchting to just TMUX
- [ ] **Linux** - Setup docker
- [ ] **Wezterm** - Clean up OS specific configurations
- [ ] Setup fonts
- [ ] Store and set `.zshenv` from MacOS
- [ ] **Refactor `dots` command** - See [docs/DOTS_COMMAND_REFACTOR.md](./docs/DOTS_COMMAND_REFACTOR.md)
- [ ] **Add test script** - Comprehensive system validation script
- [ ] **Test complete Linux setup on EndeavorOS** - Validate cross-platform functionality

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Linux:** Setup Wallpaper
- [ ] **Implement enhanced testing framework** - More comprehensive validation
- [ ] **Add configuration backup/restore functionality** - Safety features for dotfiles management
- [ ] **Improve error handling and user feedback** - Better UX for failed operations
- [ ] **Add configuration templates** - Quick setup for common tools

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Performance optimizations** - Speed up symlink operations for large configurations
- [ ] **Extended platform support** - Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/RHEL support
- [ ] **Integration with cloud sync** - Backup strategy configuration
- [ ] **Advanced logging and monitoring** - Detailed operation tracking

## Research & Investigation

- [ ] **Investigate `dots status` hanging issue** - Deep dive into execution context differences
- [ ] **Evaluate alternative symlink management approaches** - Potential architectural improvements
- [ ] **Security audit** - Review all scripts for security best practices

## Completed âœ…

- [x] Migrate wezterm
- [x] Remove `*backup` files
- [x] Archive old dotfiles
- [x] Make this repo public
- [x] Remove hooks
- [x] Add `sub-commit` command
- [x] Add `sub-status` command
- [x] Add `format` command
- [x] Standardize bash across all scripts
- [x] Implement unified dependency management (see [docs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md](./docs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md))
- [x] Implement repos cleanup workflow
- [x] Verify that install script is working
- [x] Document `~/.ssh` setup (see [docs/SSH_SETUP.md](./docs/SSH_SETUP.md))
- [x] Add cross-platform support for macOS/Linux (OS detection, package managers)
