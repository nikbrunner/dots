## Homebrew

Run `brew bundle` from the location folder of the `Brewfile` to install apps

## NeoVim

For my [NeoVim](https://github.com/nikbrunner/nibru.nvim) setup I have a dedicated repository, which is declared in this repository as a submodule, **but** needs to be cloned seperately.

## disable accented character picker

macos, by default, on long-hold of a keyboard key, will show the character picker rather than repeat the character
until key release. NOTE: you have to logout/log-back-in to the mac for this to take effect:

```bash
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

## Turn off "rearrange spaces"

- System Preferences:
  - Desktop & Dock
    - Scroll to "Mission Control"
      - turn off "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use"
